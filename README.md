## Machine learning with Keras

Worked examples following _Deep Learning with Python_ by Fran√ßois Chollet
It's an amazing [book](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python) - likely the fastest way to get started with _machine learning_!

Source code from the book available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks)

### About

This repository is WIP. Feel free to reach out with questions via _Issues_

### How to get started

Install requirements:

1. Install Python 3.6+
2. Install pip _(Pip Installs Python)_
3. Install venv _(virtual environment)_

Set up directory for work

1. `cd my-1337-ml-dir`
2. `py -m venv venv` _(creates a `venv` folder inside your dir)_
3. `source venv/bin activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt` _(place `requirements.txt` from this repository into the folder first)_

Optional:
- `alias py="python3"`
- `alias activate="source venv/bin/activate"`
